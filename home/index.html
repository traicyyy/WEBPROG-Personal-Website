      <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology, specializing in Mobile and Internet Technology, and I am in my second year.</p>

      <p>IT Experience</p>
      <p>I am a working student, and as a customer service representative, part of my role involves assisting customers with basic troubleshooting on their devices, which I believe counts as I.T. experience. Additionally, during my first year, I gained hands-on experience coding in Python and Java. I also worked on designing interfaces and user experiences for websites and mobile apps as our project in our UI/UX Design and Programming course, as well as in Mobile Programming course.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Hobbies & Interests</p>
      <p>I enjoy watching English movies and reading English novels, particularly the works of Paulo Coelho. One of my favorite books by him is The Alchemist. In my free time, I also love singing and sometimes watching anime or reading manga. Additionally, I have a keen interest in documentaries, especially those about history, murder, or real-life crime stories. Another thing that piques my interest is listening to people share their experiences, whether it’s about their work, their successes, or the hardships they’ve encountered in life. This is especially fascinating to me, as I love hearing how people have become what they chose to be and their achievements. I also watch YouTube tutorials about coding and how to use different tools that will help me in my chosen major.</p>

      <p>Goals In Life / Dream</p>
      <p>My academic path has been diverse, moving from business and management in high school to education, and now IT. Despite the unconventional journey, my goal is to graduate and use my skills to make a meaningful contribution, help my family financially, and give back to those who supported me. I aim to continuously learn, collaborate with people globally, and develop solutions for current issues. I dream of repaying my parents' sacrifices, helping the less fortunate, and someday receiving recognition for my projects. These aspirations drive me to keep learning and striving for success.</p>
