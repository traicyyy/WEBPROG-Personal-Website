          <p class="text-justify">
            Annyeong, I am Tracie Ca√±as Tomon and welcome to my personal profile web page. People call me Trace, Tres or Trai. Some of my relatives call me Budang, like the Buddha, coz I looked like the Buddha when I was born. Any shade of blue is my fave color. I like keeping things neat and tidy. Depending on my mood, I can be a bit of an introvert or an extrovert.

          <p class="text-justify">
            I'm currently in my second year pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a specialization in Mobile and Internet Technology at Asia Pacific College, where I was a Dean's Lister during AY 2023-2024, Class Representative, and member of the Microsoft Community. I previously attended Southern Leyte State University, pursuing a degree in Secondary Education majoring in General Science. I graduated from Saint Thomas Aquinas College with High Honors, serving as Associate Editor-in-Chief of the school publication and being recognized as an ABM Achiever. In Junior High, I was Class Valedictorian at Libas National High School, where I also served as SSC President, and I was a consistent honor student at Cesar C. Tan Memorial National High School.

          <p class="text-justify">
            My ultimate goal is to graduate from this course by 2027, ideally with Latin honors, despite my unconventional journey. I aspire to secure a well-paying job with a healthy working environment. I aim to leverage my skills to make meaningful contributions in the IT field, financially support my family, and repay those who have helped me. I am committed to continuous learning, collaborating with people worldwide, and developing solutions to modern problems to grow my IT career. I aspire to aid the less fortunate, honor my parents' sacrifices, and eventually gain recognition for my achievements. I don't seek luxury, but a decent, comfortable life where I have everything I need. As an avid anime fan, I dream of traveling to anime landmarks and attending concerts of my favorite K-pop group, 2NE1, and artists like Bruno Mars. I also dream of traveling the world with my family and loved ones. These ambitions drive my dedication to study and strive for success.
